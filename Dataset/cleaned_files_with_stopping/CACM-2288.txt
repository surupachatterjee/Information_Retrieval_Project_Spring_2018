 file organization the consecutive retrieval property the consecutive retrieval property is an important relation between a query set and record set its existence enables the design of an information retrieval system with a minimal search time and no redundant storage some important theorems on the consecutive retrieval property are proved in this paper conditions under which the consecutive retrieval property exists and remain invariant have been established an outline for designing an information retrieval system based on the consecutive retrieval property is also discussed cacm september 1972 ghosh s p file organization consecutive storage consecutive retrieval information retrieval record organization query structure record structure storage on tapes storage space minimum access time 370 373 374 ca720902 jb january 271978 452 pm 2288	5	2288 2288	5	2288 2288	5	2288 2729	5	2288 2288	6	2288 2801	6	2288

 algorithms to reveal properties of floatingpoint arithmetic two algorithms are presented in the form of fortran subroutines each subroutine computes the radix and number of digits of the floatingpoint numbers and whether rounding or chopping is done by the machine on which it is run the methods are shown to work on any reasonable floatingpoint computer cacm november 1972 malcolm m a floatingpoint arithmetic highlevel languages philosophy of language design 49 519 ca721102 jb january 27 1978 239 pm 2267	5	2267 2267	5	2267 2267	5	2267 2647	5	2267 2792	5	2267 2267	6	2267 2267	6	2267 2647	6	2267

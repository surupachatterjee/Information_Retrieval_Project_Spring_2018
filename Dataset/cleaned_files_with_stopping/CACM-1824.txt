 aparela parserequest language aparel is described this language is an extension to an algorithmic language pli that provides the patternmatching capabilities normally found only in special purpose languages such as snobol4 and tmg this capability is provided through parserequests stated in a bnflike format these parserequests form their own programming language with special sequencing rules upon successfully completing a parserequest an associated piece of pli code is executed this code has available for use as normal pli strings the various pieces at all levels of the parse it also has available as normal pli variables the information concerning which of the various alternatives were successful convenient facilities for multiple inputoutput streams the initiation of sequences of parserequests as a subroutine and parsetime semantic checks are also included aparel has proven convenient in building a powerful syntax and function macro system an algebraic language preprocessor debugging system an online command parser a translator for dataless programming and as a general string manipulator cacm november 1969 balzer r m farber d j text processing string processing symbol manipulation pli bnf syntax parser translator pattern matching 412 413 420 422 429 ca691106 jb february 15 1978 1244 pm 1046	4	1824 1105	4	1824 1139	4	1824 1140	4	1824 1234	4	1824 1263	4	1824 1265	4	1824 1496	4	1824 1541	4	1824 1565	4	1824 1665	4	1824 1693	4	1824 1768	4	1824 1781	4	1824 1781	4	1824 1781	4	1824 1787	4	1824 1824	4	1824 1824	4	1824 1824	4	1824 1824	4	1824 1825	4	1824 1836	4	1824 1861	4	1824 1861	4	1824 2015	4	1824 2110	4	1824 2126	4	1824 2126	4	1824 2127	4	1824 2187	4	1824 2252	4	1824 2317	4	1824 2545	4	1824 2546	4	1824 464	4	1824 2698	4	1824 2733	4	1824 584	4	1824 631	4	1824 653	4	1824 680	4	1824 763	4	1824 795	4	1824 799	4	1824 945	4	1824 1358	5	1824 1614	5	1824 1781	5	1824 1824	5	1824 1824	5	1824 1824	5	1824 404	5	1824

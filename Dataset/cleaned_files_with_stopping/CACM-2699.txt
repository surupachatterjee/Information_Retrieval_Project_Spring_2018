 automatic data structure choice in a language of very high level setl is a settheoretically oriented language of very high level whose repertoire of semantic objects includes finite sets ordered ntuples and sets of ordered ntuples usable as mappings this paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this language among other methods of interest the optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion and membership to be established the domains and ranges of tabulated mappings to be estimated from above and below and the singlevaluedness of tabulated mappings to be proved once facts of this kind have been established automatic choice of data structures becomes possible the methods employed are based upon and extend known techniques of data flow analysis cacm december 1975 schwartz j t program optimization automatic programming highlevel languages settheoretic languages data structure choice 412 420 422 ca751208 jb january 5 1978 353 pm 2699	5	2699 2699	5	2699 2699	5	2699

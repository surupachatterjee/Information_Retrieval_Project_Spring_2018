 ndimensional codes for detecting and correcting multiple errors the paper introduces a new family of codes for detecting and correcting multiple errors in a binarycoded message the message itself is arranged conceptually into a multidimensional rectangular array the processes of encoding and error detection are based upon parity evaluations along prescribed dimensions of the array effectiveness of the codes is increased by introducing a system check bit which is essentially a parity check on the other parity bits only threedimensional codes are discussed in this paper with parity evaluations along the horizontal the vertical and one main diagonal however the family of codes is not restricted to three dimensions as evidenced by the discussion by minnick and ashenhurst on a similar multidimensional singlebit selection plan used for another purpose a fourdimensional code correcting three and detecting four errors has been developed the extension to higherdimensional codes with greater correction power is straightforward cacm december 1961 rubinoff m ca611207 jb march 15 1978 1023 pm 243	5	243 243	5	243 243	5	243

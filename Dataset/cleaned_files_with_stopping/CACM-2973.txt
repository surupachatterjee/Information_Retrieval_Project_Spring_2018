 sorting on a meshconnected parallel computer two algorithms are presented for sorting n2 elements on an n x n meshconnected processor array that require on routing and comparison steps the best previous algorithm takes time on log n the algorithms of this paper are shown to be optimal in time within small constant factors extensions to higherdimensional arrays are also given cacm april 1977 thompson c d kung h t parallel computer parallel sorting parallel merge routing and comparison steps perfect shuffle processor in terconnection pattern 432 525 531 ca770409 jb december 29 1977 458 am 2973	5	2973 2973	5	2973 2973	5	2973 3156	5	2973 2289	6	2973 2973	6	2973 3075	6	2973

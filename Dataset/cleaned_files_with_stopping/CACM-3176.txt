 storing a sparse table the problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in computer science the standard technique for storing such tables is hashing but hashing has poor worstcase performance we propose a good worstcase method for storing a static table of n entries each an integer between 0 and n 1 the method requires 0n w words of storage and allows ologn n access time although our method is a little complicated to use in practice our analysis shows why a simpler algorithm used for compressing lr parsing tables works so well cacm november 1979 tarjan r yao a gaussian elimination parsing searching sparse matrix table compression table lookup 374 412 434 525 ca791104 db january 23 1980 1124 am 3041	4	3176 3126	4	3176 3176	4	3176 2905	5	3176 3176	5	3176 3176	5	3176 3176	5	3176

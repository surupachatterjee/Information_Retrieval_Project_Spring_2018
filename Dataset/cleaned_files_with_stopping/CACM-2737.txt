 determining the minimumarea encasing rectangle for an arbitrary closed curve this paper describes a method for finding the rectangle of minimum area in which a given arbitrary plane curve can be contained the method is of interest in certain packing and optimum layout problems it consists of first determining the minimalperimeter convex polygon that encloses the given curve and then selecting the rectangle of minimum area capable of containing this polygon three theorems are introduced to show that one side of the minimumarea rectangle must be colinear with an edge of the enclosed polygon and that the minimumarea encasing rectangle for the convex polygon is also the minimumarea rectangle for the curve cacm july 1975 freeman h shapira r enclosed curve optimum layout optimum packing minimumarea encasing rectangle 519 549 ca750705 jb january 9 1978 1008 am 2737	5	2737 2737	5	2737 2737	5	2737 2997	5	2737 2737	6	2737

 minimaltotalprocessing time drum and disk scheduling disciplines this article investigates the application of minimaltotalprocessingtime mtpt scheduling disciplines to rotating storage units when random arrival of requests is allowed fixedhead drum and movinghead drum and movinghead disk storage units are considered and emphasis is placed on the relative merits of the mtpt scheduling discipline with respect to the shortestlatencytimefirst sltf scheduling discipline the results of the simulation studies presented show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally superior to the other for most fixedhead drum applications the sltf discipline is preferable to mtpt but for intracylinder disk scheduling the mtpt discipline offers a distinct advantage over the sltf discipline the computational requirements of an algorithm that implements the mtpt scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to sltf algorithms in both cases the sorting procedure is the most timeconsuming phase of the algorithm cacm july 1974 fuller s h drum scheduling disk scheduling shortestlatencytimefirst sltf minimaltotalprocessingtime mtpt rotating storage units 431 441 634 635 ca740703 jb january 17 1978 107 pm 2628	4	2628 2628	4	2628 2891	4	2628 3072	4	2628 3097	4	2628 2375	5	2628 2496	5	2628 2628	5	2628 2628	5	2628 2628	5	2628 2891	5	2628 2375	6	2628 2628	6	2628

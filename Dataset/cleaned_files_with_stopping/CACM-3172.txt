 an algorithm for planning collisionfree paths among polyhedral obstacles this paper describes a collision avoidance algorithm for planning a safe path for a polyhedral object moving among known polyhedral objects the algorithm transforms the obstacles so that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitrary reference point on the moving object a trajectory of this reference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions trajectories are found by searching a network which indicates for each vertex in the transformed obstacles which other vertices can be reached safely cacm october 1979 lozanoperez t wesley m path finding collisionfree paths polyhedral objects polyhedral obstacles graph searching growing objects 315 364 366 81 ca791005 db january 17 1980 1013 am 3172	4	3172 3116	5	3172 3172	5	3172 3172	5	3172 3172	5	3172

 a parsergenerating system for constructing compressed compilers this paper describes a parsergenerating system pgs currently in use on the cdc6500 computer at purdue university the pgs is a fortrancoded compiler in the input translation grammar each bnf syntactic rule corresponds to a possibly empty code generator realizable as an assembly language fortran or algol subroutine that is called whenever that syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a program typical onepass compilers constructed by the pgs translate source programs at speeds approaching 14000 cards per minute for an xpl compiler the parser program and its tables currently occupy 288 words of 60bit core memory of which 140 words are parsing table entries and 82 words are links to code generators cacm november 1973 mickunas m d schneider v b parser generators translator writing systems syntactic analysis normalform grammars pushdown automata translation grammars translator optimization compression algorithm 412 522 523 ca731103 jb january 20 19781041 am 2179	4	2423 2423	4	2423 2423	4	2423 1337	5	2423 2015	5	2423 2423	5	2423 2423	5	2423 2423	5	2423 2733	5	2423 1781	6	2423 2179	6	2423 2423	6	2423 2786	6	2423 799	6	2423

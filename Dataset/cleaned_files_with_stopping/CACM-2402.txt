 pictorial pattern recognition and the phase problem of xray crystallography the availability of interactive threedimensional computer graphics systems coupled to powerful digital computers encourages the development of algorithms adapted to this environment pictorial pattern recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches to xray structure determination based on molecular model building ie the use of chemical information to frame structural hypotheses which can computationally be tested and refined by reference to the experimental data application of standard pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact that the crosscorrelation between a model and the correct structure cannot be computed because of a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data however it is possible to compute an upper bound to such a crosscorrelation a simple example demonstrates that this information can be the basis of a technique for structure determination that can make effective use of an interactive graphics system model building by crosscorrelations has intrinsic advantages over usual crystallographic techniques based on the autocorrelation or patterson function especially for large structures this is significant for crystallography of biological macromolecules hasbeen and will continue to be a field of intense interest cacm january 1972 lesk a m pictorial pattern recognition phase problem xray crystallography interactive graphics 313 317 363 ca720101 jb february 1 1978 953 am 2402	5	2402 2402	5	2402 2402	5	2402

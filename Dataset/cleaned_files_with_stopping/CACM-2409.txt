 an algorithm for the approximate solution of wienerhopf integral equations an explicit approximate solution is given for an equation where it is assumed that the classical wienerhopf technique may be applied it is furthermore assumed that fourier transforms are known explicitly the approximate solution depends on two positive parameters cacm november 1973 stenger f integral equations wienerhopf convolution approximate solution 518 ca731117 jb january 19 1978 336 pm 2409	5	2409 2409	5	2409 2409	5	2409

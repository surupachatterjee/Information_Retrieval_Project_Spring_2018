 variableprecision exponentiation a previous paper presented an efficient algorithm called the recomputation algorithm for evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance on a computer which performs variableprecision arithmetic operations the recomputation algorithm can be applied to expressions involving any variableprecision operations having o10p sumei error bounds where p denotes the operations precision and ei denotes the error in the operations ith argument this paper presents an efficient variableprecision exponential operation with an error bound of the above order other operations such as log sin and cos which have simple series expansions can be handled similarly cacm january 1973 richman p l variableprecision exponential function error analysis interval arithmetic 511 ca730106 jb january 24 1978 432 pm 2555	4	2555 2605	4	2555 2286	5	2555 2555	5	2555 2555	5	2555 2555	5	2555

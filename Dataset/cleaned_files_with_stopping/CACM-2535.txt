 the effects of multiplexing on a computercommunications system a study is made of the way in which asynchronous time division multiplexing changes the stochastic nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer and consequently affects the performance of a timeshared computercommunications system it is concluded that while for certain values of system parameters there is noticeable improvement in the performance of the computer model in the sense that timeshared scheduling delays are reduced these improvements are offset by the transmission delays imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or no change in the computercommunications system performance analytical and simulation results are based on the model of the computercommunications system being an md1 queue the multiplexor in tandem with a single exponential server the computer analytical results include a general description of the output process of an md1 queue and the conditions under which this output process is approximately poisson cacm march 1973 pack c d computer communications timesharing multiplexing scheduling algorithms operating systems 380 381 620 ca730304 jb january 24 1978 1113 am 2535	5	2535 2535	5	2535 2535	5	2535

 an interactive computer graphics approach to surface representation an in teractive computer graphics method has been developed for the rapid generation of arbitrary shaped threedimensional surfaces the method is a synthesis of spline theory and algorithms an in teractive means for manmachine communication and software for static or dynamic graphics display the basic technique employed is a modified lofting method on which sectional curves are represented by uniform bsplines and the surface is in terpolated between sections by cardinal splines among the features of this method are algorithms which enable in teractive modification of the bspline representation of the sectional curves at all stages of the process the spatial information is graphically displayed to the user complex surfaces can be created by the combination of a number of shapes that have been separately generated and automatically joined the system has been successfully in terfaced to a variety of analytical routines for structural medical and graphical applications cacm october 1977 wu shengchuan abel j f greenberg d p computer graphics threedimensional surface representation splines loftingfinite element input methods 320 323 334 81 82 ca771002 jb december 27 1977 1153 am 2924	5	2924 2924	5	2924 2924	5	2924

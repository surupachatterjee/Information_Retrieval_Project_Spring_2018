 a case study in programming for parallelprocessors an affirmative partial answer is provided to the question of whether it is possible to program parallelprocessor computing systems to efficiently decrease execution time for useful problems parallelprocessor systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of the processors can simultaneously execute separate tasks of a single job thus cooperating to decrease the solution time of a computational problem the processors have independent instruction counters meaning that each processor executes its own task program relatively independently of the other processors communication between cooperating processors is by means of data in storage shared by all processors a program for the determination of the distribution of current in an electrical network was written for a parallelprocessor computing system and execution of this program was simulated the data gathered from simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution of this problem typical of a large class of important problems it is shown that with proper programming solution time when n processors are applied approaches 1n times the solution time for a single processor while improper programming can actually lead to an increase of solution time with the number of processors stability of the method of solution was also investigated cacm december 1969 rosenfeld j l parallelprocessor parallelism parallel programming multiprocessor multiprogramming tasking storage interference electrical network simulation relaxation jacobi gaussseidel convergence 324 49 514 517 621 ca691201 jb february 15 1978 445 pm 1811	5	1811 1811	5	1811 1811	5	1811

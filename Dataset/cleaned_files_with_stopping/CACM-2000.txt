 a variation of the goodmanlance method for the solution of twopoint boundary value problems a recently published method for the interpolative solution of nonlinear equations is improved and applied to give a significant variation of the goodmanlance method for the solution of twopoint boundary value problems the resulting method applies in particular to the numerical solution of optimal control problems in the eulerlagrange formulation quantitative estimates are presented which indicate that the variation is nearly twice as fast on some problems in the latter context cacm september 1970 kimble g w goodmanlance boundaryvalue problems newtons method nonlinear equations optimal control optimization ordinary differential equations secant method interpolative solution orthogonal matrices 321 515 517 ca700905 jb february 10 1978 139 pm 2000	5	2000 2000	5	2000 2000	5	2000

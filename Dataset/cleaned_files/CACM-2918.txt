multiprocessor memory organization and memory interference the structure of shared memory in a multiprocessor computer system is examined with particular attention to nonin terleaved memory alternative memory organizations are compared and it is shown that a home memory organization in which each processor is associated with one or more memories in which its address space is concentrated is quite effective in reducing memory in terference home memory organization is shown to be particularly suited to certain specialized computation problems as well as to possess advantages in terms of in terference and reliability for general purpose computation results for in terleaved memory are drawn from previous work and are used for comparison tracedriven simulations are used to verify the conclusions of the analysis cacm october 1977 smith a j memory in terference interleaving multiprocessing tracedriven simulation queueing theory shared memory 430 432 634 ca771008 jb december 27 1977 1028 am 2918 4 2918 3119 4 2918 2859 5 2918 2918 5 2918 2918 5 2918 2918 5 2918

on the stability of gaussjordan elimination with pivoting the stability of the gaussjordan algorithm with partial pivoting for the solution of general systems of linear equations is commonly regarded as suspect it is shown that in many respects suspicions are unfounded and in general the absolute error in the solution is strictly comparable with that corresponding to gaussian elimination with partial pivoting plus back substitution however when a is ill conditioned the residual corresponding to the gaussjordan solution will often be much greater than that corresponding to the gaussian elimination solution cacm january 1975 peters g wilkinson j h gaussjordan algorithm gaussian elimination backsubstitution backward error analysis bounds for error in solution bound for residual 511 514 ca750104 jb january 12 1978 1044 am 2807 5 2807 2807 5 2807 2807 5 2807

on accurate floatingpoint summation the accumulation of floatingpoint sums is considered on a computer which performs tdigit base b floatingpoint addition with exponents in the range m to m an algorithm is given for accurately summing n tdigit floatingpoint numbers each of these n numbers is split into q parts forming qn tdigit floatingpoint numbers each of these is then added to the appropriate one of n auxiliary tdigit accumulators finally the accumulators are added together to yield the computed sum in all qnn1 tdigit floatingpoint additions are performed under usual conditions the relative error in the computed sum is at most t1vb1t for some v further with an additional qn1 tdigit additions the computed sum can be corrected to full tdigit accuracy for example for the ibm360 b16 t14 m63 m64 typical values for q and n are q2 and n32 in this case becomes n 32768 and we have t1vb1t 4x1613 cacm november 1971 malcolm m a floatingpoint summation error analysis 511 519 ca711105 jb february 2 1978 1048 am 1328 4 2144 1333 4 2144 2144 4 2144 1052 5 2144 2144 5 2144 2144 5 2144 2144 5 2144

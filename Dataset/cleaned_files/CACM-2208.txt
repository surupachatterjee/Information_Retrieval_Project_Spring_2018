storage utilization in a memory hierarchy when storage assignment is performed by a hashing algorithm the utilization of storage is studied in a twolevel memory hierarchy the first storage level which is the fast store is divided into a number of storage areas when an entry is to be filed in the hierarchy a hashing algorithm will attempt to place the entry into one of these areas if this particular area is full then the entry will be placed into the slower secondlevel store even though other areas in the firstlevel store may have space available given the n entries have been filed in the entire hierarchy an expression is derived for the expected number of entries filed in the firstlevel storehis expression gives a measure of how effectively the firstlevel store is being used by means of examples storage utilization is then studied as a function of the hashing algorithm the number of storage areas into which the firstlevel store is divided and the total size of the firstlevel store cacm march 1971 williams j g hashing algorithms memory allocation memory hierarchy memory utilization storage allocation storage hierarchy storage utilization 374 43 ca710304 jb february 3 1978 437 pm 2208 5 2208 2208 5 2208 2208 5 2208

on the nearoptimality of the shortestlatencytimefirst drum scheduling discipline for computer systems in which it is practical to determine the instantaneous drum position a popular discipline for determining the sequence in which the records are to be accessed is the socalled shortestlatencytimefirst sltf discipline when a collection of varyinglength records is to be accessed from specified drum positions it is known that the sltf discipline does not necessarily minimize the drum latency time however we show that the total time to access the entire collection for any sltf schedule is never as much as a drum revolution longer than a minimum latency schedule cacm june 1973 stone h s fuller s h drum scheduling shortestaccesstimefirst minimal latency scheduling shortestlatencytimefirst 431 441 635 ca730604 jb january 23 1978 312 pm 2496 5 2496 2496 5 2496 2496 5 2496 2628 5 2496 3097 5 2496 2375 6 2496 2496 6 2496 2496 6 2496

an improved programsynthesizing algorithm and its correctness an improved programsynthesizing algorithm based on the algorithm proposed by waldinger and lee in 1969 is given in the old algorithm the programsynthesizing problem is translated into a theoremproving problem and a program is obtained by analyzing a proof for the improved algorithm the analysis is not necessary and a program is obtained as soon as the proof is completed this is achieved by using a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by green in 1969 the correctness of the improved algorithm is also proved ie the program thus obtained always satisfies the specification cacm april 1974 lee r c t chang c l waldinger r j programsynthesizing algorithms theorem proving consequence finding primitive resolutions 360 364 420 442 521 522 524 ca740413 jb january 18 1978 932 am 2657 4 2657 2719 4 2657 2210 5 2657 2657 5 2657 2657 5 2657 2657 5 2657 2719 5 2657 1626 6 2657 210 6 2657 2151 6 2657 2167 6 2657 2210 6 2657 2645 6 2657 2657 6 2657

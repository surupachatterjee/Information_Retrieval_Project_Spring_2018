hierarchical storage in information retrieval a probabilistic analysis is employed to determine the effect of hierarchical storage organizations on information retrieval operations the data storage hardware is assumed to consist on nlevels of linearly connected memory hardware with increasing data access times and increasing data storage capabilities a system might for example consist of fast semiconductor memory computer core memory extended core storage disk memory and data cells equations are derived to predict the effect of such a system on data access times using sequential files random access files and structured files employing multiplehierarchical linked lists cacm may 1973 salasin j information retrieval hierarchical storage 370 372 373 374 379 390 620 634 ca730504 jb january 24 1978 848 am 2516 5 2516 2516 5 2516 2516 5 2516

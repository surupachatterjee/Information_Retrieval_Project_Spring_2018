performance of rollback recovery systems under intermittent failures a mathematical model of a transactionoriented system under intermittent failures is proposed the system is assumed to operate with a checkpointing and rollbackrecovery method to ensure reliable information processing the model is used to derive the principal performance measures including availability response time and the system saturation point cacm june 1978 gelenbe e derochette d database reliability file systems checkpoints recovery procedures checking techniques reliability and system performance evaluation 372 373 433 435 46 55 81 ca780608 dh february 9 1979 1026 am 3089 4 3089 2599 5 3089 3089 5 3089 3089 5 3089 3089 5 3089

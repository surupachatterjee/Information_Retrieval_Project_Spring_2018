an algorithm using symbolic techniques for the belpetrov classification of gravitational fields in this note an algorithm is presented for the symbolic calculation of certain algebraic invariants of the weyl tensor which permits the determination of the belpetrov types of a gravitational field this algorithm although more specialized than that of dinverno and russellclark requires neither the use of a special coordinate system nor the spin coefficient formalism the algorithm has been implemented in formac and is designed to complete the classification scheme proposed by petrov in his book an appendix contains examples illustrating the use of the algorithm cacm september 1978 harris r zund j general relativity belpetrov types formac symbolic manipulation tensors 311 315 317 ca780901 dh february 5 1979 343 pm 2170 4 3071 3071 4 3071 2165 5 3071 3071 5 3071 3071 5 3071 3071 5 3071

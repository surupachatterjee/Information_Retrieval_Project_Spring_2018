connections between accuracy and stability properties of linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear kstep formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations an upper bound pk is derived for the order of accuracy of ainfstable formulas three criteria are given for a0stability it is shown that 1 for pk k arbitrary ainfstability implies certain necessary conditions for a0stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of ppsi satisfy psi1 2 for pk234and 5 ainfstability for k5 together with another constraint implies strict stability and 3 for certain oneparameter classes of formulas with pk34andor 5 ainfstability implies a0stability cacm january 1975 liniger w stiff equations parametrized linear multistep formulas order of accuracy a0stability ainfstability strict stability 517 ca750111 jb january 12 1978 926 am 2800 5 2800 2800 5 2800 2800 5 2800

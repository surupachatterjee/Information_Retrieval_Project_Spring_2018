numerical integration of a differentialdifference equation with a decreasing timelag systems in which variable timelags are present are of common occurrence in biology variable flow rates are a common cause of these variable lags at present no extensive body of knowledge exists concerning the effects which these variable lags can cause shown here is a method of reducing some differentialdifference equations to ordinary differential equations which can then be studied numerically with ease subsequent study will deal with situations in which multiplelags and lags dependent on the solution itself are present cacm april 1965 bellman r e buell j d kalaba r e ca650411 jb march 7 1978 346 pm 1280 5 1280 1280 5 1280 1280 5 1280 1364 5 1280 1280 6 1280

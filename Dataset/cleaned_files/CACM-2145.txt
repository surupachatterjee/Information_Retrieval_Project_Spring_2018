automation of etchingpattern layout help heuristic etchingpattern layout program is an application program developed to computerize the tedious and errorprone although vitally important wiring design of printed circuit boards help helps automate a design stage one step closer to production than logical design it can be used to design wiring patterns of twolayer circuit boards on which ics in dualinline packages as well as discrete components such as transistors and resistors have been placed help employs two methods of wiring one is the heuristic method which simulates human approaches to wiring design and the other is the theoretically interesting but timeconsuming method of mazerunning based on the lees algorithm help performs more than 90 percent of required wiring by the heuristic path with respect to a performance function for each pointtopoint and pointtoline connection it can bring the number of successful wiring connections very close to 100 percent cacm november 1971 aramaki i kawabata t kazuhiko a heuristic etchingpattern layout wiring design of printed circuit board mazerunning lees algorithm 324 366 49 69 ca711104 jb february 2 1978 1058 am 2145 5 2145 2145 5 2145 2145 5 2145

further evidence for the analysis of algorithms for the zeroone programming problem the purpose of this note is to report computational experience additional to that recently summarized by gue et al with two algorithms for the zeroone linear programming problem an error in gues paper is corrected the utility of one of the algorithms as a suboptimizer is indicated cacm january 1971 proll l g operations research integer programming zeroone variables algorithms 539 541 ca710108 jb february 8 1978 1032 am 2226 4 2226 2226 4 2226 1658 5 2226 1666 5 2226 2226 5 2226 2226 5 2226 2226 5 2226

minimal eventnode network of project precedence relations a procedure for constructing a minimal eventnode network to represent a set of precedence relations without parallel activities is presented a minimal eventnode network is an eventnode network in which both the number of nodes and the number of arcs are the minima to preserve the given precedence relations counterexamples are given to show that the algorithm presented by a c fisher j s liebman and g l nemhauser 1968 produces eventnode networks which are not minimal since our procedure includes the setcovering problem the time required may grow exponentially with the number of given activities cacm may 1973 corneil d g gotlieb c c lee y m network project eventnode network activitynode network minimal eventnode network dummy activity project precedence relations 357 532 83 ca730505 jb january 24 1978 842 am 2515 4 2515 1723 5 2515 2515 5 2515 2515 5 2515 2515 5 2515

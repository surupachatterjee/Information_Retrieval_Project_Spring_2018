a language for treating geometric patterns in a twodimensional space in this paper cadep a problemoriented language for positioning geometric patterns in a twodimensional space is presented although the language has been specifically designed for the automatic generation of integrated circuit masks it turns out to be well suited also for such other placement problems as architecture design urban planning logical and block diagram representation the design criteria the structure and the specific features of cadep are illustrated cacm january 1971 bracchi g ferrari d graphic language problemoriented language twodimensional patterns graphic display fortran extension layout problems integrated circuit architecture design urban planning 323 324 325 422 ca710104 jb february 8 1978 1117 am 2230 4 2230 2003 5 2230 2044 5 2230 2230 5 2230 2230 5 2230 2230 5 2230 996 6 2230 1558 6 2230 2230 6 2230 521 6 2230

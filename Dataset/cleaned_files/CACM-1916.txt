analysis of boolean program models for timeshared paged environments directed graphs or their associated matrices are frequently used to represent the logical structure of sequences of computer instructions such techniques are used and in addition data references are represented in a nondirected model the complete structural specification of a program is represented by a combined model a transformation of the combined model yields a new model in which additional timing information is also contained analysis of these models prior to execution yields information valuable in determining segmentation of instructions and data for a timeshared environment as well as for initial page loading during execution the analysis may be used for look ahead control of page turning cacm april 1969 lowe t c timesharing paging segmentation executive compiler monitor program model 439 621 ca690401 jb february 17 1978 450 pm 1916 4 1916 1916 4 1916 1533 5 1916 1916 5 1916 1916 5 1916 1916 5 1916 2130 5 1916 666 5 1916 1916 6 1916
